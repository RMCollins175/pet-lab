# SOLUTION

## Estimation

Estimated: 7/8 hours for completetion of the task. Outstanding: Responsive style and more tests.

Spent: x2 evenings worth, so around 6 hours. it was intermingled with some gaming, so I couldn't be sure exactly.

## Solution

I'm pretty happy with my solution, I think I covered all the requirements.

At first I wasn't sure how to filter through an array of tags in a query, but managed to find the `_like` query string from a post online.

I wasn't sure about the price filter, as no product had a price of 30, but I think I covered it.

Definitely could have used some more tests, improved Error handling, and a responsive design but these were not essential to requirements.

URLSearchParams was a new topic for me. I found it useful for filtering through the query string, when multiple filters were selected. It took me a bit of time understanding how it worked.
